        <h2>Looking at Memo-ization</h2>
        <p>
            Last class, I asked you to memo-ize the naive, recursive
            Fibonacci algorithm. Let's take a look at how to do that.
            <br>
            <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/algorithms/blob/master/fibonacci.py">Here</a>
            is the Fibonacci code, now including memo-ization.

        Operations associated with this data type allow:
        <ul>
            <li>the addition of a pair to the collection
            <li>the removal of a pair from the collection
            <li>the modification of an existing pair
            <li>the lookup of a value associated with a particular key
        </ul>

        time/answer/even termination change from one run to the next.
