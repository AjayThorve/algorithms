                What is a greedy algorithm?
            </h2>

                <p>
                We have an optimization problem.
                <br>
                At each step of the algorithm, we have to make a choice, e.g.,
                cut the rod here, or cut it there.
                <br>
                Sometimes, we need to calculate the result of all possible
                choices.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When we do so from the top down, we have a <i>recursive
                    algorithm</i>. A naive recursive algorithm may be very
                    expensive, but we can significantly reduce its run-time by
                    <i>memoizing</i> it.
                    <li>When we do this calculation from the bottom up, we are
                        employing <i>dynamic programming</i>.
                </ul>

                <p>
                But sometimes, we can do much better than either of those
                choices. Sometimes, we don't need to consider the global
                situation at all: we can simply make the best choice among the
                options provided by the first sub-problem we face, and then
                continue that procedure for all subsequent sub-problems.
                <br>
                <br>
                An algorithm that operates in such a fashion is a <i>greedy
                algorithm</i>. (The name comes from the idea that the
                algorithm <i>greedily</i> grabs the best choice available to it right
                away.)
                <br>
                <br>
                Clearly, not all problems can be solved by greedy algorithms.
                Consider this simple shortest path problem:
                <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                A greedy algorithm choosing the shortest path from <i>a</i> to <i>d</i> will
                wrongly head to <i>b</i> first, rather than to <i>c</i>.
                <br>
                <br>
                And that provides us a <a href="#hw1">homework problem</a>.

                </p>

                    Given a graph G, any tree that includes all of the vertices
                    of G is called a <i>spanning tree</i>. The lowest-weight tree
                    that does that is a <i>minimum spanning tree</i>.

                    Our intuition might tell us that choosing the shortest path
                    from MetroTech Center to Yankee Stadium is a simpler problem
                    than choosing a minimum spanning tree for all New York subway
                    stations. Yet the latter can be solved with a greedy algorithm,
                    while the first cannot. Why?
                    <li>Why is the run-time analysis of the rod cutting problem not
