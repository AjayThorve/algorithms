            What is this?
            <ul>
                <li><b>Divide</b> the problem into a number of sub problems that are
                    smaller instances of the same problem.
                <li><b>Conquer</b> the sub problems by solving them recursively. If
                    the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve
                    the subproblems in a straightforward manner.
                <li><b>Combine</b> the solutions for the sub problems into the
                    solution for the original problem.

                <br>
                We "solve" these by finding a closed-form equation that
                describes the recurrence but without recursion.
                <br>
                <b>Solution</b>: T(n) = &Theta;(n lg n)

                        Solves recurrences of the form:
                        <br>

                <br>
                <b>Technicalities</b>
                <br>
                We often omit floors, ceilings, and boundary conditions. For
                instance, if n is odd, we may say n / 2 anyway.

                Try every combination of two elements!
                <br>
                A n choose 2 problem, so order of &Omega;(n<sup>2</sup>).
                <br>
                n choose 2 will be about 1/2 n<sup>2</sup>, since it equals
                n(n - 1) / 2. So we can establish a lower bound by setting c =
                1/3, for instance, and n choose 2 will always be bounded from
                below by c*n<sup>2</sup>.

            <h4>
                A transformation

            <p>
            We loon at the problem differently: let's find the nonempty,
            contiguous subarray of our array whose values have the largest sum.
            We call this the <b>maximum subarray</b>.
            </p>

            <h4>
                A solution using divide-and-conquer
            </h4>
            <p>
            To solve this problem, we divide an array A into three subarrays,
            and ask what is the maximum subarray in each:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>From A[low] to A[midpoint - 1].
                <li>Crossing the mid-point.
                <li>From A[midpoint + 1] to A[high]
            </ol>

            <p>
            Problems 1 and 3 are simply this same problem on a smaller array!
            Problem 2 can be solved by finding the maximum subarrays in
            low-to-mid and in mid+1-to-high.
            <br>
            <br>
            The recurrence is the same as for merge sort.

            <h3>
                Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication
            </h3>

                <h4>
                    Recursive Square-Matrix Multiply
                </h4>
                <p>
                    We divide each of our initial matrices into four
                    sub-matrices, and multiply them. Which we do by dividing
                    each of them into four...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the base case when each matrix has only one member, we
                    just multiply them and return the result.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So what is our recurrence? Each step except the base case
                    multiplies eight matrices of size n / 2. So they
                    contribute 8T(n / 2) to running time. There are also four
                    matrix additions of matrices containing n<sup>2</sup> / 4
                    entries -- squared because n specifies an n x n matrix. So
                    this contributes &Theta;(n<sup>2</sup>) time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So our recurrence is:
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    The master method will show us that the solution to this
                    recurrence is:
                    <br>
                    T(n) = &Theta;(n<sup>3</sup>) 
                </p>

                <br>
                    By adding ten additions, we can cut the divide portion of
                    our algorithm down to seven multiplications instead of
                    eight.

                    <br>
                    Here is the method:

                    <br>
                    For two matrices:

                    <img src="graphics/RecEq8.gif">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Define:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    P<sub>1</sub> = A(F - H)
                    <br>
                    P<sub>2</sub> = H(A + B)
                    <br>
                    P<sub>3</sub> = E(C + D)
                    <br>
                    P<sub>4</sub> = D(G - E)
                    <br>
                    P<sub>5</sub> = (A + D) * (E + H)
                    <br>
                    P<sub>6</sub> = (B - D) * (G + H)
                    <br>
                    P<sub>7</sub> = (A - C) * (E + F)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then:
                    <br>

                    <b>Important Lesson</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are often serious trade-offs between set-up time and
                    aymptotic run-time. One must carefully consider how large
                    one's inputs are likely to be before opting for a complex
                    algorithm like Strassen's. On modern hardware optimized for
                    matrix multiplication, matrix sizes often need to be in the
                    thousands before Strassen's algorithm yields significant
                    gains.

                    <br>
                    Why is this the recurrence? Well, to move disk <em>n</em>,
                    we first move disks 1 to <em>n</em> - 1 to the spare peg,
                    then move <em>n</em> to the target peg, then move disks 1
                    to <em>n</em> - 1 to the target peg.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So we guess the closed-form solution is something like
                    2<sup>n</sup>. Why? Well, we multiply by a factor of 2 each
                    recursion!
                    <br>
                    Now, let's try writing out a few elements of the sequence:
                    <br>
                    T(0) = 0
                    <br>
                    T(1) = 2*0 + 1 = 1
                    <br>
                    T(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3
                    <br>
                    T(3) = 2*3 + 1 = 7
                    <br>
                    T(4) = 2*7 + 1 = 15
                    <br>
                    T(5) = 2*15 + 1 = 31
                    <br>
                    So is the answer 2<sup>n</sup> - 1?
                    <br>
                    Base case: T(0) = 0 = 2<sup>0</sup> - 1.
                    <br>
                    Yes!
                    <br>
                    Now induction: we want to show that, <em>if</em> T(n - 1) =
                    2<sup>(n - 1)</sup> - 1, <em>then</em> T(n) will equal
                    2<sup>n</sup> - 1.
                    <br>
                    How proof by induction works: we have proved our base case.
                    Now we try to prove that for any n, if for n - 1 our
                    hypothesis is true, then it is true for n as well. And since we
                    have already proved that for n = 0 it is true, that will
                    mean it will be true for all n whatsoever.
                    <br>
                    So we substitute in for n - 1:

            <h3>
                The recursion-tree method for solving recurrences
            </h3>
                <p>
                There are two ways to use this method:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>As a way to generate a guess for the substitution
                        method.
                    <li>As a way to generate a rigorous answer by itself.
                </ol>

                <p>
                Analyze the tree:
                <br>
                <br>
                <img
                src="graphics/NSquaredTree1.png">
                <br>
                <br>
                Calculate the work at each level:
                <br>
                <br>
                <img
                src="graphics/NSquaredTree2.png">
                <br>
                <br>
                This produces the geometric series:
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="graphics/RecEq4.gif">
                <br>
                <br>
                If we set a = n<sup>2</sup> and r = 1/2, then we have the
                general sum of a converging geometric series:
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="graphics/RecEq5.gif">
                <br>
                <br>
                So the solution here is O(n<sup>2</sup>). The amount of work at
                each level is reduced by a power of two, and so is
                just a constant factor times the root.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Another example</b>:
                <br>
                <br>
                In our textbook, we have the recurrence:
                <br>
                T(n) = 3T(n / 4) + cn<sup>2</sup>, c > 0
                <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                a<sup>log<sub>b</sub>c</sup> = c<sup>log<sub>b</sub>a</sup>

                </p>
