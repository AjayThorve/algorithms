                What is a binary search tree?
            </h2>

                Running time

            <p>
                <b>Worst case:</b> &Theta;(n)
                <br>
                This occurs when the tree simply makes one long chain.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Average case:</b> &Theta;(lg n)
                <br>
                That is because the expected height of a randomly built binary
                search tree is O(lg n).

                Let x be a node in a binary search tree. If y is a node in the
                left subtree of x, then y.key &le; x.key. If y is a node in the
                right subtree of x, then y.key &le; x.key.

            <p>
                Why do we pass in a node rather than the tree itself?
                <br>
                Note why CLRS pseudo-code for max and min contains mistake
                from practical point of view.
                <br>
                Library code versus application code.
                <br>
                Library must protect itself against both malicious and merely
                inept users. So, need to check for NIL input!
                <br>
                <br>
                Recursive versus loop: compare the two searches.
                <br>
                <br>
                All searching functions (search, minimum, maximum, predecessor,
                successor run in <em>O(h)</em> time, where <em>h</em> is the height of
                the tree.
                <br>

            <h3>
                Successor
            </h3>
            <p>
                Let's walk through successor for our tree above.
                <br>
                <br>
                Imagine we are seeking the successor of 3. The right tree of
                three is non-empty. So we simply seek the minimum of that tree,
                which is the leftmost node in the tree, in this case, 4.
