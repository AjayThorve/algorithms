            Design and Analysis of Algorithms: Homework 3
        </h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Demonstrate, in a double hashing situation, how the choice of the
                table size can lead to the algorithm working as designed, or
                completely failing. Buy "demonstrate", I mean show how a small
                table of the right size will fill up properly in double hashing
                while a table with a badly chosen size will stop accepting
                data before it is filled. Your answer should be something like,
                "First we will insert x and that will go in slot y... But when
                we come to insert z that will fail because..."

            <li>In the hiring problem with a randomized candidate list, please
                explain why the odds of hiring the i<sup>th</sup> candidate are
                1 / i.

            <li>Explain the difference between implementing a dictionary using
                direct addressing and simply using array indices to access some
                piece of data.

            <li>Explain why linear probing will tend to produce clusters.

            <li>Consider the following hashing scheme:
                <br>
                <em>h(k) = k mod m</em>
                <br>
                <em>m = 7</em>
                <br>We convert a string into a hashable key by treating it as a
                base-8 number.
                <br>So 'abc', where a = 1, b = 2, and c = 3, is converted to a
                key as follows: 1 * 8<sup>2</sup> + 2 * 8 + 3 = 83.
                <br>In this hashing scheme, what do the strings 'cba' and 'bac'
                hash to?
                <br>Can you write a more general statement about a pattern we
                can detect here? Something along the lines of, "If the table
                size is 2<sup>P</sup> - 1, and strings are interpreted in radix
                2<sup>P</sup>..."
