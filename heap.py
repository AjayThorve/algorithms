"""
Because Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen et al.) include priority queues in
their discussion of heap sort, I have made a separate heap.py file,
as I do not want to clutter the sorting.py file too much.
so here we have routines to establish and maintain the heap, as well as
heapsort itself and a priority queue function.
As in sorting.pY, the intention is to closely duplicate the pseudocode from
the book, and again, print statements will be interleaved into the code to help
students understand how the algorithms works.
We will allow max or min heaps based on a passed comparison operator.
This file contains:
    heapify()
    build_heap()
    heapsort()
    heap_insert()
    heap_extract_max()
    heap_increase_key()
    heap_maximum()
