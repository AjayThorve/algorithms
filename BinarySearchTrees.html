                What is a binary search tree?

                Running time

            <p>
                <b>Worst case:</b> &Theta;(n)
                <br>
                This occurs when the tree simply makes one long chain.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Average case:</b> &Theta;(lg n)
                <br>
                That is because the expected height of a randomly built binary
                search tree is O(lg n).

                Querying a binary search tree
            </h2>
            <p>
                Why do we pass in a node rather than the tree itself?
                <br>
                Note why CLRS pseudo-code for max and min contains mistake
                from practical point of view.
                <br>
                Library code versus application code.
                <br>
                Library must protect itself against both malicious and merely
                inept users. So, need to check for NIL input!
                <br>
                <br>
                Recursive versus loop: compare the two searches.
                <br>
                <br>
                All searching functions (search, minimum, maximum, predecessor,
                successor run in <em>O(h)</em> time, where <em>h</em> is the height of
                the tree.

            <h3>
                Search
            </h3>
            <p>
                We search by starting with the root node. If it's key is equal
                to the key for which we are searching, we are done: that is the
                key we want.
                <br>
                On the other hand, if we have a NIL node at hand, we are also done,
                but have failed to find the key.
                <br>
                Finally, if neither is true, we check the key at hand against
                the key sought for.
                <ul>
                    <li>If k &lt; curr.key, recursively call tree search on curr.left.
                    <li>Else recursively call tree search on curr.right.
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>
                <b>Example:</b>
                <br>Let's search for 4 in the tree above.
                <ul>
                    <li>4 &lt; 8; move left
                    <li>4 &gt; 3; move right
                    <li>4 &lt; 6; move left
                    <li>Voila!
                </ul>
            </p>

            
            <h3>
                Minimum and maximum
            </h3>

            <p>
            To find the minimum, we simply walk down the left side of the tree.
            <br>
            To find the maximum, we simply walk down the right side of the tree.
            </p>


            <h3>
                Successor
            </h3>
            <p>
                Similarly, let's walk through successor for our tree above.
                <br>
                <br>
                Imagine we are seeking the successor of 3. The right tree of
                three is non-empty. So we simply seek the minimum of that tree,
                which is the leftmost node in the tree, in this case, 4.
                <br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, take this tree, and start with node 10.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Let's walk through insert for tree 1 above.
                <br>
                <br>
                We will insert 5. (When I say "Insert x," you should take that
                to be shorthand for "Insert a node with key x.")
                <ul>
                    <li>5 &lt; 8, so we move left.
                    <li>5 &gt; 3, so we move right. 
                    <li>5 &lt; 6, so we move left.
                    <li>5 &gt; 4, so we move right and insert. 
                </ul>

            <h3>
                Delete
            </h3>
            <p>
                Deletion is by far the most complicated coding of any of these
                functions. There are four cases (and z is the node to delete):
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                <li>z has no left child. (This handles two cases!)
                    <br>
                    <b>Action:</b> Replace z by its right child, which might be
                    NIL.
                <li>z has only a left child.
                    <br>
                    <b>Action:</b> Replace z by its left child.
                <li>z has two children.
                    <br>
                    <b>Action:</b> Find z's successor y, which lies in its
                    right sub-tree.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If y is z's right child, replace z by y.
                        <li>Otherwise, replace y by its own right child, then
                            replace z by y.
                    </ul>

            </ol>
            <p>
                Let's walk through deleting 8 in tree 2 above.
            </p>

                Randomly built binary search trees
            </h2>
            <p>
                We insert the keys randomly. (We would have to have all keys at
                hand at the start, and then do a random shuffle on the set of
                keys.) The expected height of such a tree is O(lg n).
